# TIC TAC TOE GAME
In this project, it is assigned for us to create a Tic Tac Toe game using only Ruby to increase our knowledge on the OOP concepts. This project was split in 4 milestones, which were:

 - Setting up the project
 - Designing the user interface
 - Creating the game logic
 - Writing the game instructions
 
 The main goal of this project is to asure I master the methods ruby provides and to learn how to replicate them using basic coding knowledge.

# Built With

- Linters

# Prerequisites

A 3x3 grid is displayed on the terminal and the first player chooses a number to place his symbol on that number's position
